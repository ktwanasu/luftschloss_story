On our way to Berlin form Raesfeld we stubbled across a group of wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst enthusiast, apparently the Hund a famous wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst was preparing to eat a large number of Bratwurst and schloss the world record for most Bratwurst eaten in one sitting.
Amidst the cheering crowd, we spotted a Biergarten booth offering chilled drinks and Baeckerei treats, with a sign that humorously read, "Refueling Station for Wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst Fans!"
We ventured further down the Hauptstrasse where we discovered a unique scene: locals in Lederhose and Dirndel racing Porsches and BMWs towards the Flughafen, with winners receiving a special Apfelkuchen from the renowned Mehlhase BÃ¤ckerei.
